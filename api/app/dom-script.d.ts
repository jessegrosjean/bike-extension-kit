/**
 * DOMScripts allow extensions to display UI using HTML/DOM.
 *
 * Normally, extension code runs in a headless JSContext. This code has access
 * to Bike-specific APIs, but cannot use HTML/DOM. To display custom UI your
 * extension installs a DOMScript into a WebView that's hosted by Bike.
 *
 * If you've used Web Workers, the architecture will feel familiar: both run in
 * isolated script contexts and communicate with the originating context using
 * `postMessage` and `onmessage`.
 *
 * DOMScripts are loaded by name and must be located in the `src/dom` folder of
 * your extension. Bike API's that allow you to install DOMScripts include
 * `window.presentSheet` and `window.inspector.addItem`.
 *
 * DOMScripts Summary:
 *
 * 1. Used to display UI using HTML/DOM.
 * 2. Do not have access to standard extension APIs.
 * 3. Run in a separate context from standard extension code.
 * 4. Must be located in the extension's `src/dom` folder and loaded by name.
 * 5. Communicate with extension code via `postMessage` and `onmessage`.
 * 6. For security some HTML/DOM APIs (e.g., network access) are disabled.
