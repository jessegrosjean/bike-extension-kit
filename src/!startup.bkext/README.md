# Startup

This is the code for the standard Bike startup extension:

1. It is always loaded second, after the Bike extension.
2. It is shipped with Bike and Bike will install itself in the Bike extensions
   folder if it doesn't alreayd exist. If it does already exist then Bike will
   NOT replace it.

Good place to experiment with your own ideas. If you come up with something that
you want to share then you should move that code to it's own extension so you
can share it.
