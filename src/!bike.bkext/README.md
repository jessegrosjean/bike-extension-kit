# Bike

This is the code for the standard Bike extension:

1. It is always loaded first, before any other extension.
2. It is shipped with Bike and is not meant to be modified.
3. Bike will automatically install/replace this extension on each launch.

This is a good source to learn and see how extensions are built. If you
experiment with it remember that you'll have to reinstall your changed version
after each Bike launch.
